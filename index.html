            <div class="h2vlak"><h2>Migration: a repeated, patterned journey in which creatures are drawn in one direction toward a food supply or resource, and in the other direction toward breeding grounds. Humpback whales, forr example, spend their summers straining krill, plankton, and small fish through their great baleen plates in the polar region of the North Pacific Ocean.</h2></div>

        <div class="paragraafmain">
            <div class="paragraaf"><p>Come winter, when conditions grow harsh and the food supply dwindles, the whales swim south—some as far as five thousand miles—navigating the vast ocean with incredible precision to breeding grounds in Hawaii, Mexico, Central America, and Asia, until cues from their environment beckon them north again. This pattern repeats every year of their lives.</p></div>
            <div class="paragraaf"><p>Thousands of species of migratory creatures—at least four thousand species of birds alone—embark on epic journeys across and around the world every year as they are pulled into flowing patterns of movement that correspond to the sun’s steady pull on the Earth. Birds, insects, mammals, and fish follow felt sensory signals in currents of air and water, changes in season, the planet’s magnetic field, the position of the sun and stars, subtle changes in temperature. Earth’s ecological systems, in this way, are woven together by intricate and far-reaching threads of movement./p></div>
            <div class="paragraaf"><p>What about our rooted companions? The northeastern spruce-fir forests that the Bicknell’s thrush journeys to every spring, or the stands of jack pine where the eastern bluebird builds its nests? We often admire trees for their steady rootedness, their resiliency in the face of change; for the gift of shade and companionship that a single long-lived tree might offer us and then our children and our grandchildren, even our great-grandchildren. But trees—or, more appropriately, forests—are perhaps not so rooted, so reliably placed, as we might think.</p></div>

                <div class="paragraaf"><p>Some scientists prefer the phrase “shifts in range” to “migration” when it comes to forests—ecosystems defined by long-lived, woody beings that cannot pull up their roots from beneath the forest floor and walk or swim or fly when conditions around them indicate it is time to do so. But trees do move, they simply do it through successive generations.</p></div>
                <div class="paragraaf"><p> Trees reproduce primarily through seed dispersal, relying upon animals, winds, and waters to carry their offspring to fertile soils where they might anchor into the ground and germinate. A mature tree will send seeds in all directions. In a stable environment, where conditions are much the same as when the parent tree began its life, a forest might continue to regenerate in roughly the same location and the same configuration of species, year after year, decade after decade.</p></div>

                    <div class="paragraaf"><p>But what if a new generation of seeds is cast into the wind during a period of drought? What if winters are no longer as cold as they once were? What if a certain pest can now survive in a forest where it once could not? Suddenly, seedlings might find themselves in a less friendly environment that they are not genetically well adapted to. Perhaps the only ones that will survive are those that happen to be carried, say, northward, or to a slightly higher elevation. As the climate changes in and around forests, seeds might succeed in places where they did not before or fail where they once succeeded.

In 2019, NASA stated that eighteen of the nineteen warmest years on record had occurred since 2001. Around the world, scores of species of trees are moving north, or west, or upslope. Some species are losing ground, others are gaining it. In the eastern United States, eighty-six species of trees are currently on the move. Pines, spruce, and firs are generally heading north; oaks and maples are heading west. Here in Maine, seven of the ten most common species of tree are predicted to have moderate to severe reductions in suitable habitat within a century.</p></div>

                        In a quiet neighborhood just a mile and a half from the University of Maine, a small conserved parcel of wooded land rests in the softness of dawn. A creek runs through the woods; along the creek a black ash tree is growing amid apple, paper birch, and white pine. Tall and gnarled with knots and cracks in the folding bark that runs up her wide and weathered trunk, she is still at this early hour. Her lower branches have mostly broken off, the wounds healed over. The part of her that is green—her pinnately compound leaves with their finely serrated leaflets—is high in the canopy, poised to drink in the rising sun.
